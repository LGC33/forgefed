      <p>ForgeFed is a federation protocol for enabling interoperability between version control services. It's built as an extension to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a> protocol, allowing users of any ForgeFed-compliant service to interact with the repositories hosted on other instances.</p>
      <p>The goal of the project is to support all of the major activities connected to project management, including bug reports, merge requests, and notifications across instances.</p>
      <p>This website serves as the official place where to find up to date information and links about the project.</p>
      <h1 id="why-forgefed"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Why ForgeFed?</h1>
      <p>The current state of code collaboration is dominated by centralized, proprietary platforms. Free alternatives to these platforms exist (for example <a href="https://notabug.org">NotABug</a> and <a href="https://pagure.io">Pagure</a>) but they do not solve the problem of centralization.</p>
      <p>This project tries to address exactly this problem. Our wish is to devise a free and standardized mechanism for enabling collaboration across any version control platform.</p>
      <h1 id="project-status"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Project status</h1>
      <p>The specification and software produced but this working group is still in the early stages, and there is still much work to do and ample design-space for discussion and contributions.</p>
      <p>So far the protocol supports:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>repository following</li>
      <li>repository push notifications to followers</li>
      <li>new issue creation</li>
      </ul>
      <h1 id="work-group"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Work group</h1>
      <p>Community and development discussions are conducted on the <a href="https://talk.feneas.org/c/forgefed">ForgeFed Forum</a>, with informal, real-time collaboration often taking place on the #peers IRC channel on freenode. In order to be most widely adopted, we strive to assemble the most diverse and representative group including: users, implementers, and various domain experts. Anyone who is experienced with working on an existing forges or federated &quot;social&quot; services, and anyone with experience in writing technical specification documents is encouraged to join the work-group and/or contribute artifacts.</p>
      <h1 id="implementations"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Implementations</h1>
      <ul>
      <li><em><a href="https://dev.angeley.es/s/fr33domlover/r/vervis">Vervis</a></em> is the reference implementation of ForgeFed. It serves as a demo platform for testing the protocol and trying new features</li>
      <li><em><a href="https://notabug.org/zPlus/mcfi">mcfi</a></em> is another command line implementation for testing the protocol</li>
      </ul>
